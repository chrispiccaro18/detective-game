            <p id="narration">You come to and notice your hands and legs are bound. You hear a voice in the distance, “I shoulda just given you the address to my apartment!” Your eyes focus on a man with a glass eye standing a fair distance away from you. He’s grinning with an unlit cigar in his mouth. You shift your body so your hands can start to untie your feet. “But I’m a sporting guy and it looks like you are too“, he flips a lighter and ignites his cigar. You release the knot restraining your feet and shake your leg. Your switchblade creeps out of your pocket. He blows out a few puffs, “Plus I needed a sap to tie a double murder on. You may not know it but you’ve been digging your own grave.” Straining, you awkwardly pick up the knife with a hand that’s still bound. “After murdering my lover and kidnapping the daughter, you were asking around town for me, your last victim. You followed my trail to my latest housing development”, he waves his hand to the skeleton of the building behind him. You pop open the blade and start working on the rope binding your hands. “You came to kill me, but I’ve subdued you and am about to deliver you to the grateful hands of the police. Who are on their way now,” he winks with his good eye. Slicing through the last thread you hands become unbound and you reach for your gun. “What are you doing?” the cigar drops out of his mouth. You spit out some words, “Just making sure the cops will know the truth”. “No! This isn’t how it was supposed to go!” You raise your hand cannon while the man in the glass eye lunges towards you!</p>
            <p id="instructions">This is the final showdown. When you’re ready click the button to start the timer. You’ll have a few seconds to take down the man with the glass eye. After the timer starts click on the image of the man with the glass eye to shoot him. One shot won’t be enough, but five hits should take him out. Good luck!</p>
